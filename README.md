# Hotel Reservation System

## Introduction

This Python program implements a simple hotel reservation system using SQLite, demonstrating the author's knowledge of Python, SQLite, and object-oriented programming principles. The system allows users to manage hotel rooms, make reservations, and check room availability.

## Features

- **Room Management:** Users can view and manage hotel rooms, including room number, capacity, and availability.
- **Reservation:** Users can reserve available rooms, and the system updates room availability accordingly.
- **Availability Search:** Users can search for available rooms based on the number of people they need to accommodate.
- **Room Release:** Reserved rooms can be released, making them available for new reservations.

## Code Structure

- `hotel_reservation_system.py`: The main Python script containing the hotel reservation system code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing instructions and information about the project.

## Usage

1. Run the `hotel_reservation_system.py` script to start the hotel reservation system.

2. The program will display a welcome message and menu options to manage rooms, make reservations, search for availability, and release reserved rooms.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations.

## Dependencies
